    /*
        There are a lot more ways to manipulate the DOM but they follow the same idea
        You will most likely need to select an element
        You will use some method that will change its state/behavior
        
        I won't go too much in detail with ways to traverse into a DOM
        Mostly because React changes the game on how you can change the information of your DOM (it made it a lot easier and less repetitive)
